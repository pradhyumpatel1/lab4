## ITMD 362 Lab 4: Color Palettes

For this lab, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site 
Paletton, http://paletton.com. Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste 
the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette. You’ll see that the uid value in 
the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make. Write 2 sentences 
explaining why you chose the colors you did. Opt for the Paletton Preview mode 
Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: 
http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Create a Basecamp post "Lab-4: your name" and simply post the following as plain text. 

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: : http://paletton.com/#uid=53+0h0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: The dark blue/purple palette I picked is ideal for a new console gaming platform because people usually game in dark backgrounds to avoid much brightness. This dark blue doesn't have much contrast which is often bad for gamers. I personally game and tend to like darker backgrounds.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL:  http://paletton.com/#uid=32V0N1ktAtnaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkm8AQaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkxUviaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: The color palette includes green, yellow, and purple. They are all colors of flowers during the spring. This bright colors will give a sense of the true colors that people might expirence on the tours. I have been there personally so I know the colors in the park are really bright.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=35w0S1ktAtnaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkyhLzaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkxUviaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: The color palette includes the blue, yellow, and red. I chose the color blue to give a color that people are already familiar with. Usaully blue corresponds to a message being "sent". The color yellow is a color used by snapchat so people also know that it can relate to sending something. 

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=15v0S0kjEnw7esb9pjpwrqfxJin
Your Rationale: The color palette includes the color red. Since the palette is monochromatic, I had to use red for ruby. The website for ruby on rails also includes the color red primarily. Since its a advestisement on Ruby's site, using the color red is going to make the eyes see a familiar color, instead of a very dull color.
